# Arduino / ESP32 Game Engine

## Features
- Graphics engine
- Timers
- Melody engine
- Controller for buttons
- Physics engine for particles
- Haptics for vibration feedback

## Suported hardware
All ESP32 and Arduinos should work fine.  
I use ESP32-S3 8x8 matrix for the console but other screens can be used with few code modifications.
